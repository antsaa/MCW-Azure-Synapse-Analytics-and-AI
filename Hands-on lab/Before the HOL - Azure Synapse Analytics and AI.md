# Azure Synapse Analytics before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. An Azure Account with the ability to create an Azure Synapse Workspace.
2. [Ensure the Microsoft.Sql resource provider is registered in your Azure Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).

## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 40 minutes

### Task 1: Clone Github repo in Azure Cloud Shell

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the Azure Portal, open the Azure Cloud Shell by selecting its icon from the right side of the top toolbar. Be sure to select **PowerShell** as the shell type.

    ![A portion of the Azure Portal taskbar is displayed with the Cloud Shell icon highlighted.](media/bhol_azurecloudshellmenu.png "Opening the Cloud Shell")

    > **Note**: If you are prompted to create a storage account for the Cloud Shell, agree to have it created.

3. In the Cloud Shell window, enter the following command to clone the repository files.

    ```PowerShell
    git clone https://github.com/antsaa/MCW-Azure-Synapse-Analytics-and-AI.git Synapse-MCW
    ```


4. Keep the Cloud Shell open.

### Task 2: Run environment setup PowerShell script

When executing the script below, it is important to let the scripts run to completion. Some tasks may take longer than others to run. When a script completes execution, you will be returned to a command prompt.

1. In the Cloud Shell, change the current directory to the **automation** folder of the cloned repository by executing the following:

    ```PowerShell
    cd './Synapse-MCW/Hands-on lab/environment-setup/automation'
    ```

2. Execute the **Setup-all.ps1** script to provision the resources and to set them up by executing the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    ./Setup-all.ps1
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter the name of your desired Azure Subscription. You can copy and paste the value from the list to select one. You will also be prompted for the following information for this script:

    | Prompt |
    |--------|
    | Enter the desired Azure Subscription for this lab [you will be able to copy and paste from a listing] |

    ![The Azure Cloud Shell window is displayed with a sample of the output from the preceding command.](media/bhol_sampleshelloutput.png "The Azure Cloud Shell output")

3. At the end of the script, you should see a message indicating **Environment validation has succeeded**.

    ![The PowerShell console output displays with a message indicating the Environment validation has succeeded.](media/environment_validation_success.png "Environment Validation")

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
